# PhD-is-worth

In this notebook we try to understand if doing a PhD is the best bang for your bucks. As PhD students ourselves, we are totally aware that the value of doing a PhD goes beyond the mere financial aspect. Still, we think it is an interesting question to ask. To answer it we use data about the salary of STEM workers from companies such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and other tech companies.

They always say "you do not do a PhD for the money" and they are absolutely right. The only reason to do a PhD is passion for the subject. However, according to our analysis, if one has a PhD and wants to start a career in data science, having a PhD might not be a bad idea.

This is a joint work with Marco Murtinu.
The analysis is public on Kaggle:
